## What would I do differently?

- create basic entity system
- use classes? or ...?
- use centre-point for *everything*
- shared timer/callback system
- simple animation system based on shared timer
- load all images first with standard loader
- simple standard out-of-bounds system
- be careful about saving and restoring context
- consider sprite sheets
- a few text tools (e.g. centre)
- a tiny maths library (e.g draw circle point/distance/collision)



## Sprite Sheets
